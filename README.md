**** the demo video about project is also available in the same directory named 'project video' ****

- created a website which is similar to online apps whick takes orders from the user and updates teh cart in the database
- features include addition to cart,removal from cart,updating the cart,order summary
- this is mainly built using django framework.
- website will contain homepage,pizzapage,burgerpage,cartpage,succespage,loginpage,signuppage each one developed using django and javascript
- can easily add the required pizzas and burgers in required quantity into cart and can alter that in pizzapage or burgerpage as well as cartpage
- after succesfully adding items to cart we can mention additional details which we have to give for the seller in the cartpage.
- before final ordeing it will ask you to login if you haven't logged in.
- if user doesn't have account he can signup.
- after ordering the user will be redirected to a success page where it contains a unique ordernumber,details and order contents.
- this is main core idea of the project.
